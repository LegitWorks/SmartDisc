# SmartDisc
School project for Haaga Helia. 
  
In this project we are creating a smart device that will be attached to a disc golf disc. The device will have a buzzer to help find the disc if it is thrown in to the bush. It will also have sensors for acceleration and gyro, so we can get the top speed and rotation speed of the disc. Gyro sensor will also be used to get the angle of the disk.
  
The idea is that the player can use these information to help better their play.
